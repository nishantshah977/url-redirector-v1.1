# url-redirector-v1.1

This is the updated version of [url-redirector](https://github.com/nishantshah977/url-redirector)

In it's first version **Social Media Platforms were able to detect that it contains blocked websites**. So,
I have fixed that issue.

Let me remind you about this project again.

**This Project Aims to Solve problem related to URL Sharing on Social Media Platform in which some url are blocked. This project will create a timer based url which can be shared on social media platforms.**
